## About this directory

Most files in this directory are directly inlined from the 
[Discount][http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/] library.

Files specific to RDiscount include:

* rdiscount.c -- The main glue between rdiscount.rb and Discount.
* extconf.rb -- Generates the Makefile that compiles everything in this directory.
* config.h
    * Discount's version of this file is generated by `configure.sh`.
    * For RDiscount, this file cooperates with the define flags passed in by
      `extconf.rb`'s generated Makefile to simulate the `config.h` file
      generated by Discount's `configure.sh` script.
* README.markdown -- This file.

## Upgrading to a new Discount version

* Remove old Discount files in this directory.
* Add Discount files from your new Discount version to this directory.
* If Discount's `configure.sh` changed between the old and new versions
  of Discount that you're upgrading between, you may need to update
  `extconf.rb` and `config.h`. This is left as a (potentially difficult)
  exercise for the reader.

## Adding support for new Discount extensions to Markdown

You will need to update:

* `rdiscount.rb` with new accessors and
* the `rb_rdiscount__get_flags` function in `rdiscount.c` with new
  accessor-to-flag mappings for each new extension.
