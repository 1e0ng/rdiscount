<http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/MarkdownTest_1.0.zip>

Discount was developed by

extension was developed by Ryan Tomayko <http://tomayko.com/>.

Discount is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work. The Ruby Discount extension adopts
Discount's license verbatim. See the file COPYING for more information.
